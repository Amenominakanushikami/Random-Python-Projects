#when player inputs invalid number of lives, it asks him for word length, need to change it to a while loop instead of calling the function recursively :(
#could add a counter with messages for certain events, for example, if the player guessed the word 3 times, the message "3 in a row!" would appear
#all things considered, I did a pretty good job
